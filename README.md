## Features

- **Single-Model Detection**: Utilizes a robust DeepFake detection model to analyze media content.
- **File Upload**: Supports uploading images (jpg, png, jpeg), videos (mp4, mov), and audio files (mp3, wav).
- **URL Input**: Allows users to input URLs for image, video, or audio analysis.
- **Processing Unit Selection**: Option to use GPU for supported models (default is CPU).
- **Result Visualization**:
  - Displays DeepFake detection statistics in a table format.
  - Provides downloadable CSV of detection results.
  - Visualizes results with bar charts for DeepFake probability and inference time.
